To commit changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Stage the changes you want to commit. To stage all changes, use the `.`:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3. Commit the changes. Be sure to include a meaningful commit message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
    ```

4. Push the changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Replace `main` with the name of the branch you're pushing to if it's not the main branch.
